## Technologies Used
- This project utilizes the MEAN stack to implement a clone of a popular social networking site
  - MongoDB, Express.JS, Angular.JS, Node.JS
- I chose MEAN because I wanted more practice implementing a project with this stack
- bcryptjs became a crucial part of this project when I decided to add users to the project. Almost half of the time spent working on this project involved working out user logins, encrypted passwords, and sessions.

## Installation
- The app is up on heroku at https://barklife.herokuapp.com.
- If you fork/clone this repo, you will need Node, NPM, and MongoDB installed locally. If you have these, you can run npm install in directory to install dependencies. The localhost is set to 3000.


## To Do
- Add logged in profile photos
- Add Giphy API call for random gifs
- add motto/tag line
- Redirect to root when sign up

### Known Issues
- Images should be already cropped to square aspect for best viewing
- Usernames do not have to be unique as of now, that's a problem!
